Description of data files:
“Population_data_Gutierrez_etal”
“Susceptibility_data_Gutierrez_etal”
“Length_data_Gutierrez_etal”


For the file: “Population_data_Gutierrez_etal.” These data are from the weekly sampling of the populations during the “population experiment” portion of the project. 
Beaker = replicate number
Sample_num = the week each sample was taken
Predation = the selective predation treatment where “Infected” = infected individuals were removed, “Uninfected” = uninfected individuals were removed, and “Random” = both infected and uninfected individuals were removed
*Adult_F = uninfected adult female
*Ephi_F = uninfected adult female carrying an ephippium (resting egg)
*Juv_F = uninfected juvenile female
*Ad_M = uninfected adult male
*Juv_M = uninfected juvenile male
*Inf_Ad_F = infected adult female
*Inf_Ephi_F = infected adult female carrying an ephippium (resting egg)
*Inf_Juv_F = infected juvenile female
*Inf_Ad_M = infected adult male
*Inf_Juv_M = infected juvenile male
Total_num = total number of individuals counted in the 100mL sample
Infected_num = number infected
Prop_inf = proportion infected
Prop_juv = proportion juveniles
*Values in columns with an asterisk are the number of individuals in each category found in the 100mL subsample of the population on a given sampling day. 


For the file “Susceptibility_data_Gutierrez_etal.” These data are the results of the infection trial in the “population susceptibility” portion of the project. 
Beaker = replicate number of the original population
Predation = the selective predation treatment where “Infected” = infected individuals were removed, “Uninfected” = uninfected individuals were removed, and “Random” = both infected and uninfected individuals were removed
Num_infected = the number of individuals identified as infected for each beaker at the end of the susceptibility trial
Num_uninfected = the number of individuals identified as uninfected for each beaker at the end of the susceptibility trial


For the file “Length_data_Gutierrez_etal.” These data are the measurements of length from the extra animals in the maternal lines from the “population experiment” portion of the projection.  
Beaker = replicate number of the original population 
Mat_line = an indicator of the maternal line within each beaker (replicate). We started 20 maternal lines from each original beaker, but not all of them survived for us to measure. 
Indiv_num = an indicator of up to the three individuals measured for each maternal line within each beaker
Length_mm = the length of each individual measured, in mm, from the middle of the eye to the base of the tail
